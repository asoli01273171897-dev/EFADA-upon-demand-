This is a desktop app that automate the process of clock in/out for students or employees 
I will focus in this mini documentation on the main logic and how it works the app has more functionalities than these I will mention 
I used the Face_recognition module from dlib 
in this specific model it works with histogram matching it breaks image into small cells (8*8) and map to histogram pattern and it looks for patterns that match the face pattern 
so first the user take the photo when signing in or singing up 
2. the image is sent to be encoded as mentioned before
3.the face matching process using the eculdian distance to find similarity (checked against peolpe we know file that save the photos of known peolple)
4.the app has the ability to generate static reports the password of the admin is sss 
if you have any questions iam more than happy to hear from you 01044916567
